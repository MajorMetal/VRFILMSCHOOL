		<p class='section-text'> Welcome to VR Film School; a 2 day work shop teaching VR enthusiasts how to become VR directors. The goal is to go from knowing nothing about VR to having a piece of 360 video content that is yours to share with the world. There will be different tracks of education for different workflows like "Shooting with GoPro Rigs" or "Shooting with the theta camera". We are bringing together major VR film directors, hardware providers and technical experts to help you get started right. </p>
		
		<p class='section-text'>After class, teams will be givin one week to create or make changes to their movies and submit them by that next friday. Sunday we will judge the videos in Hollywood for our VR Film Festival.</p>
